# 01 | information about the blog

hello! i recently started learning a great library for web development, Nuxt.js. so i decided, why not make a blog?

this website was made with [nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [@nuxt/ui](https://ui.nuxt.com), [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxt.com), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and [iconify](https://icones.js.org/) libraries.
